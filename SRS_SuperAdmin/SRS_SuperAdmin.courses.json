              "topicContent": "Laws of Reflection\n\nWhat is Reflection?\nWhen light rays fall on a surface and bounce back into the same medium, this phenomenon is called reflection of light.\n\nImportant Terms:\n• Incident ray - The light ray falling on the reflecting surface\n• Reflected ray - The light ray bouncing back from the surface\n• Normal - An imaginary line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence\n• Point of incidence - The point where incident ray hits the surface\n• Angle of incidence (i) - Angle between incident ray and normal\n• Angle of reflection (r) - Angle between reflected ray and normal\n\nThe Two Laws of Reflection:\n\nFirst Law of Reflection:\nThe incident ray, reflected ray, and normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.\n\nSecond Law of Reflection:\nThe angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\nMathematically: ∠i = ∠r\n\nTypes of Reflection:\n\n1. Regular Reflection (Specular Reflection):\n• Occurs when light falls on smooth, polished surfaces\n• All reflected rays are parallel to each other\n• Forms clear and sharp images\n• Examples: Plane mirrors, still water surface, polished metals\n• Used in mirrors, telescopes, periscopes\n\n2. Irregular Reflection (Diffuse Reflection):\n• Occurs when light falls on rough, unpolished surfaces\n• Reflected rays scatter in different directions\n• No clear image is formed\n• Examples: Walls, paper, wood, unpolished metals\n• Enables us to see objects from different positions\n• Makes reading possible (light reflects from paper)\n\nCharacteristics of Images formed by Plane Mirror:\n• Virtual (cannot be obtained on screen)\n• Erect (same orientation as object)\n• Same size as object\n• Laterally inverted (left appears right)\n• Distance of image = Distance of object from mirror\n\nApplications of Reflection:\n\n1. Mirrors in Daily Life:\n• Plane mirrors - dressing tables, bathrooms\n• Concave mirrors - shaving mirrors, dentist mirrors, headlights\n• Convex mirrors - rear-view mirrors, street corners, shops\n\n2. Optical Instruments:\n• Periscope - uses two plane mirrors at 45° angle\n• Kaleidoscope - multiple mirrors creating symmetrical patterns\n• Reflecting telescopes - use curved mirrors to collect light\n• Solar cookers - use concave mirrors to concentrate sunlight\n\n3. Safety and Signaling:\n• Reflectors on roads and vehicles for night visibility\n• Cat's eyes on road dividers\n• Reflective clothing for workers\n• Emergency signaling mirrors\n\nMathematical Problems:\n\nExample 1: If a light ray makes an angle of 30° with the normal, what will be the angle of reflection?\nSolution: By second law of reflection, ∠r = ∠i = 30°\n\nExample 2: If incident ray makes 45° with the mirror surface, find angle of reflection.\nSolution: Angle with normal = 90° - 45° = 45°\nTherefore, angle of reflection = 45°\n\nMultiple Images:\nWhen two plane mirrors are placed at an angle θ:\nNumber of images formed = (360°/θ) - 1\n\nExample: Two mirrors at 60° angle\nImages formed = (360°/60°) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 images",

              "topicContent": "Refraction of Light\n\nWhat is Refraction?\nThe bending of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another is called refraction of light.\n\nWhy does Refraction occur?\nRefraction occurs due to change in speed of light when it moves from one medium to another medium of different optical density.\n\nImportant Terms:\n• Incident ray - Ray falling on the boundary between two media\n• Refracted ray - Ray entering the second medium after bending\n• Normal - Perpendicular to the boundary at point of incidence\n• Angle of incidence (i) - Angle between incident ray and normal\n• Angle of refraction (r) - Angle between refracted ray and normal\n• Optical density - Property of medium that determines speed of light\n\nLaws of Refraction:\n\nFirst Law:\nThe incident ray, refracted ray, and normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.\n\nSecond Law (Snell's Law):\nThe ratio of sine of angle of incidence to sine of angle of refraction is constant for given pair of media.\n\nMathematically: sin i / sin r = constant\nOr: n₁ sin i = n₂ sin r\n\nWhere n₁ and n₂ are refractive indices of first and second medium respectively.\n\nRefractive Index:\n\nDefinition:\nRefractive index of a medium is the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to speed of light in that medium.\n\nFormula: n = c/v\nWhere:\nn = refractive index\nc = speed of light in vacuum (3×10⁸ m/s)\nv = speed of light in the medium\n\nRefractive Index of Common Materials:\n• Air/Vacuum = 1.0003 ≈ 1 (reference)\n• Water = 1.33\n• Glass = 1.5 (approximately)\n• Diamond = 2.42 (highest among common materials)\n• Ice = 1.31\n• Alcohol = 1.36\n\nRules of Refraction:\n\n1. When light enters a denser medium (higher refractive index):\n   • Light bends towards the normal\n   • Speed of light decreases\n   • Wavelength decreases but frequency remains same\n\n2. When light enters a rarer medium (lower refractive index):\n   • Light bends away from the normal\n   • Speed of light increases\n   • Wavelength increases but frequency remains same\n\n3. When light falls perpendicularly (normal incidence):\n   • No bending occurs (i = r = 0°)\n   • Light passes straight through\n\nPhenomena due to Refraction:\n\n1. Apparent Depth:\n• Objects in water appear closer to surface than they actually are\n• Real depth appears less than actual depth\n• Formula: Real depth / Apparent depth = Refractive index of water\n• Example: A coin in water appears raised up\n\n2. Bending of Pencil in Water:\n• Pencil appears bent at water surface\n• Due to different refraction of light from different parts\n\n3. Twinkling of Stars:\n• Due to atmospheric refraction\n• Air density keeps changing due to temperature variations\n• Starlight gets refracted continuously\n• Planets don't twinkle as they appear as discs, not points\n\n4. Advanced Sunrise and Delayed Sunset:\n• Sun appears about 2 minutes before actual sunrise\n• Sun appears about 2 minutes after actual sunset\n• Due to refraction of sunlight by Earth's atmosphere\n\n5. Mirage:\n• Optical illusion in deserts\n• Due to total internal reflection in hot air layers\n• Appears like water surface in distance\n\nApplications of Refraction:\n\n• Lenses in spectacles for vision correction\n• Camera lenses for focusing\n• Microscope and telescope lenses\n• Optical fibers for communication\n• Prisms for dispersion of light\n• Glass windows and doors\n• Contact lenses\n• Magnifying glasses",

RATIONAL NUMBERS (Q)\n\nDefinition: Numbers that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\n\nSet: Q = {p/q : p, q ∈ Z, q ≠ 0}\n\nForms of Rational Numbers:\n\na) Fractions:\n• Proper fractions: 1/2, 3/4, 5/7 (numerator < denominator)\n• Improper fractions: 5/3, 7/4, 9/2 (numerator ≥ denominator)\n• Mixed numbers: 2½, 3¾, 4⅔\n\nb) Integers:\n• Any integer can be written as fraction: 5 = 5/1, -3 = -3/1\n\nc) Terminating Decimals:\n• Decimals that end after finite digits\n• 0.5 = 1/2, 0.25 = 1/4, 0.125 = 1/8\n• 0.75 = 3/4, 0.875 = 7/8\n\nd) Non-terminating Repeating Decimals:\n• Decimals with repeating pattern\n• 0.333... = 1/3 (1/3 = 0.3̄)\n• 0.666... = 2/3 (2/3 = 0.6̄)\n• 0.142857142857... = 1/7 (1/7 = 0.142857̄)\n• 0.090909... = 1/11 (1/11 = 0.09̄)\n\nIdentifying Terminating/Non-terminating:\nA rational number p/q (in lowest terms) has:\n• Terminating decimal if q has only factors of 2 and 5\n• Non-terminating repeating decimal otherwise\n\nExamples:\n• 3/8: q = 8 = 2³ → Terminating (0.375)\n• 7/20: q = 20 = 2² × 5 → Terminating (0.35)\n• 1/6: q = 6 = 2 × 3 → Non-terminating (0.1666...)\n• 5/12: q = 12 = 2² × 3 → Non-terminating (0.41666...)\n\n5.

Assume √2 is rational, so √2 = p/q (lowest terms)\n2. Then 2 = p²/q², so 2q² = p²\n3. This means p² is even, so p is even\n4. Let p = 2k, then 2q² = 4k², so q² = 2k²\n5. This means q² is even, so q is even\n6. Both p and q are even, contradicting lowest terms assumption\n7. Therefore, √2 is irrational\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUMBER SETS:\n\nHierarchy: N ⊂ W ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R\n\nThis means:\n• Every natural number is a whole number\n• Every whole number is an integer\n• Every integer is a rational number\n• Every rational number is a real number\n• Some real numbers are irrational\n\nREAL NUMBERS = RATIONAL NUMBERS ∪ IRRATIONAL NUMBERS\n\nNumber Identification Table:\n\n| Number | Natural | Whole | Integer | Rational | Irrational | Real |\n|---------|---------|-------|---------|----------|------------| ---- |\n| 7       | ✓       | ✓     | ✓       | ✓        | ✗          | ✓    |\n| 0       | ✗       | ✓     | ✓       | ✓        | ✗          | ✓    |\n| -5      | ✗       | ✗     | ✓       | ✓        | ✗          | ✓    |\n| 3/4     | ✗       | ✗     | ✗       | ✓        | ✗          | ✓    |\n| 0.75    | ✗       | ✗     | ✗       | ✓        | ✗          | ✓    |\n| √3      | ✗       | ✗     | ✗       | ✗        | ✓          | ✓    |\n| π       | ✗       | ✗     | ✗       | ✗        | ✓          | ✓    |\n\nIMPORTANT PROPERTIES:\n\n1.

              "topicContent": "Euclid's Division Algorithm\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nEuclid's Division Algorithm is a systematic method for finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) or Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. It is based on Euclid's Division Lemma and is one of the oldest algorithms known to mankind.\n\nEUCLID'S DIVISION LEMMA:\n\nStatement:\nGiven any two positive integers a and b, there exist unique integers q and r such that:\na = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b\n\nTerminology:\n• a = Dividend (the number being divided)\n• b = Divisor (the number by which we divide)\n• q = Quotient (the result of division)\n• r = Remainder (what is left over)\n\nKey Points:\n• The remainder r is always non-negative and less than the divisor b\n• If r = 0, then b divides a completely\n• This relationship always holds for any two positive integers\n• The quotient and remainder are unique for given a and b\n\nExamples of Division Lemma:\n\nExample 1: a = 17, b = 5\n17 = 5 × 3 + 2\nHere: q = 3, r = 2, and 0 ≤ 2 < 5 ✓\n\nExample 2: a = 100, b = 7  \n100 = 7 × 14 + 2\nHere: q = 14, r = 2, and 0 ≤ 2 < 7 ✓\n\nExample 3: a = 48, b = 6\n48 = 6 × 8 + 0\nHere: q = 8, r = 0, and 0 ≤ 0 < 6 ✓\n(Since r = 0, we say 6 divides 48 completely)\n\nEUCLID'S ALGORITHM FOR FINDING HCF:\n\nThe Algorithm:\nTo find HCF of two positive integers a and b (where a > b):\n\nStep 1: Apply Euclid's division lemma to a and b\n        a = bq₁ + r₁, where 0 ≤ r₁ < b\n\nStep 2: If r₁ = 0, then HCF(a,b) = b\n        If r₁ ≠ 0, apply division lemma to b and r₁\n        b = r₁q₂ + r₂, where 0 ≤ r₂ < r₁\n\nStep 3: If r₂ = 0, then HCF(a,b) = r₁\n        If r₂ ≠ 0, apply division lemma to r₁ and r₂\n        r₁ = r₂q₃ + r₃, where 0 ≤ r₃ < r₂\n\nStep 4: Continue this process until the remainder becomes 0\n        The last non-zero remainder is the HCF\n\nWhy does this work?\n• HCF(a,b) = HCF(b,r₁) = HCF(r₁,r₂) = ... = HCF(rₙ₋₁,0) = rₙ₋₁\n• The algorithm terminates because remainders keep decreasing\n• Since remainders are non-negative, we must eventually reach 0\n\nSOLVED EXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1: Find HCF of 56 and 72\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: 72 = 56 × 1 + 16\n        (a = 72, b = 56, q = 1, r = 16)\n\nStep 2: 56 = 16 × 3 + 8\n        (a = 56, b = 16, q = 3, r = 8)\n\nStep 3: 16 = 8 × 2 + 0\n        (a = 16, b = 8, q = 2, r = 0)\n\nSince remainder = 0, HCF(56, 72) = 8\n\nVerification:\n56 = 8 × 7 and 72 = 8 × 9\nSince HCF(7,9) = 1, our answer is correct.\n\nExample 2: Find HCF of 867 and 255\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: 867 = 255 × 3 + 102\nStep 2: 255 = 102 × 2 + 51\nStep 3: 102 = 51 × 2 + 0\n\nSince remainder = 0, HCF(867, 255) = 51\n\nVerification:\n867 = 51 × 17 and 255 = 51 × 5\nSince HCF(17,5) = 1, our answer is correct.\n\nExample 3: Find HCF of 1651 and 2032\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: 2032 = 1651 × 1 + 381\nStep 2: 1651 = 381 × 4 + 127  \nStep 3: 381 = 127 × 3 + 0\n\nSince remainder = 0, HCF(1651, 2032) = 127\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF EUCLID'S ALGORITHM:\n\n1. Simplifying Fractions:\nTo reduce fraction a/b to lowest terms:\n• Find HCF(a,b)\n• Divide both numerator and denominator by HCF\n\nExample: Simplify 48/72\nHCF(48,72) = 24\n48/72 = (48÷24)/(72÷24) = 2/3\n\n2. Finding LCM using HCF:\nFor any two numbers a and b:\nLCM(a,b) × HCF(a,b) = a × b\nTherefore: LCM(a,b) = (a × b)/HCF(a,b)\n\nExample: Find LCM of 56 and 72\nHCF(56,72) = 8 (calculated above)\nLCM(56,72) = (56 × 72)/8 = 4032/8 = 504\n\n3. Solving Linear Diophantine Equations:\nEquations of the form ax + by = c can be solved using Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n\n4. Finding Co-prime Numbers:\nTwo numbers are co-prime if HCF = 1\nExample: HCF(15,28) = 1, so 15 and 28 are co-prime\n\nPROPERTIES OF HCF:\n\n1. HCF(a,b) = HCF(b,a) [Commutative]\n2. HCF(a,0) = a for any positive integer a\n3. HCF(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) [HCF cannot exceed the smaller number]\n4. If d = HCF(a,b), then HCF(a/d, b/d) = 1\n5. HCF(ka, kb) = k × HCF(a,b) for any positive integer k\n6. If HCF(a,b) = 1, then HCF(a,bc) = HCF(a,c)\n\nPRACTICE PROBLEMS:\n\nProblem 1: Use Euclid's algorithm to find HCF of 135 and 225\n\nSolution:\n225 = 135 × 1 + 90\n135 = 90 × 1 + 45\n90 = 45 × 2 + 0\n\nHCF(135, 225) = 45\n\nProblem 2: Find the largest number that divides 70 and 125, leaving remainders 5 and 8 respectively.\n\nSolution:\nThe required number divides (70-5) = 65 and (125-8) = 117\nSo we need HCF(65, 117)\n\n117 = 65 × 1 + 52\n65 = 52 × 1 + 13\n52 = 13 × 4 + 0\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13.\n\nVerification:\n70 = 13 × 5 + 5 ✓\n125 = 13 × 9 + 8 ✓\n\nProblem 3: Show that any positive odd integer is of the form 6q + 1 or 6q + 3 or 6q + 5.\n\nSolution:\nBy Euclid's division lemma, any integer a can be written as:\na = 6q + r, where r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5\n\n• If r = 0: a = 6q (even)\n• If r = 1: a = 6q + 1 (odd)\n• If r = 2: a = 6q + 2 = 2(3q + 1) (even)\n• If r = 3: a = 6q + 3 (odd)\n• If r = 4: a = 6q + 4 = 2(3q + 2) (even)\n• If r = 5: a = 6q + 5 (odd)\n\nTherefore, any positive odd integer is of the form 6q + 1, 6q + 3, or 6q + 5.\n\nADVANTAGES OF EUCLID'S ALGORITHM:\n\n• Efficient: Works quickly even for very large numbers\n• Systematic: Follows a clear, step-by-step procedure\n• Universal: Works for any pair of positive integers\n• Ancient wisdom: One of the oldest known algorithms (300 BCE)\n• Foundation: Basis for many modern cryptographic algorithms\n• Exact: Always gives the correct HCF without approximation",
